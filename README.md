# react-colorizer-example

This is a usage example repo for the react-colorizer:

The colorizer allows a "2.5D" representation of images generated in 3D software (Rhino and SketchUp). Elements of the image can be colored or have their visibility switched on/off. This solution allows 3D stacking to occur by supporting overlapping pixels through a secondary data image. Multiple layers may be overlaid to form the final composite image.
